                <div class='val_bio_describe'>Valentina Polcovnicova (born in Moldova, 1991) comes from a diverse
                    cultural background. Her
                    mother is a representative of a small Bulgarian minority community of Moldova, while her father
                    is Russian. From as early as childhood, Valentina has been exposed to a mixture of traditions and
                    got involved in folk dancing present in Moldova. During her university years in Moscow,
                    Valentina became interested in theater dance and visual art forms, both of which has become her
                    extra-curriculum activities.<br><br>
                    Valentina obtained her MA in Linguistics and Translation Studies (RSUH, Moscow, Russia -
                    2013). Valentina also had the opportunity to complete a course on Anthropology and Modern
                    Dance at Beloit College (WI, USA -2012) and a semester of Ethno-Cultural Diversity and Visual
                    Arts in KU Leuven (Belgium – 2014). Those courses further developed her curiosity about
                    cultures and a move to China allowed for more of the same.<br><br>
                    Valentina lived and taught dance in Hangzhou, China, for three years. She became an active
                    member of the Contemporary dance community there by staging performances and organizing
                    workshops. At the same time, she learnt about Chinese arts and local practices, such as
                    calligraphy and Qi dance.<br><br>
                    All of Valentina’s travelling let to an increased fascination of cultural diversity, particularly
                    dance practices that exist in the world. She decided to learn more about dance anthropology and
                    cultural management and was accepted into the Choreomundus Master program in Dance
                    Knowledge, Practice and Heritage. She is currently finishing her dissertation on contemporary
                    dance festivals.
