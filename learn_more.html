      <p>"Bodies in our time have become sites of display." ~ Orbach, 2009

      <p class='font_adj_mob'>Body Museum is currently an online exhibition that potentially could grow and occupy a space in a gallery or a museum as it will benefit from a life performance that accompanies the art works.  This project tackles ‘the relationships between the public display of the bodily motion and the articulation of social categories of identity, of their transmission, transformation, perception, and enactment’ (Desmond, 1997: 3). Currently, the project focuses on bodies shaped while sitting, particularly, emphasis is on legs and feet position. In the future, more poses and usage of different body parts will be explored such as hands folding or a standing body.
        <br>
            <br>
The name of the project has been inspired by the reading of Janet Goodridge’s (2011: 120) article where she presents her vision of her body as ‘a living dance museum – an inner archive or repository of dance/movement-arts practice’. Seeing body as an archive of past events triggered the idea of curating bodies’ archive by the means of ethnographic photography. Participants are asked to sit in the way they would sit in a certain situation and it is visually documented and presented on this website and Instagram.
<br>
    <br>
This work spotlights a cultural body, its assimilation of cultures, which is exposed in ways of sitting. Anthropologist Ted Polhemus (1993: 7) explains: ‘Where one personally stood in relationship to this clash of cultures was precisely encapsulated in how one walked down the street, sat in a chair, leaned against a wall or moved on a dance floor’. In other words, the way we sit or move is determined by the cultures we grew up in.
<br>
    <br>
Furthermore, Susie Orbach (2009: 8) writes: ‘As we perform our exercises, do our hair, put on our clothes, we are underpinning how we wish to be seen and how we see ourselves’. This presence of unconscious or conscious ‘awareness of being watched’ (Howson, 2004) while sitting influences the choice of the position. Especially among women, ‘seeing oneself as an object shapes how women move through the physical environment’ (ibid: 59) and how much space they occupy while sitting.
<br>
    <br>
The gender differences stand out in the photographs and that proves one more time that, ‘in any society and at any point in human history there have always been two significant categories of experience which inevitably and profoundly distort any individual’s subjective perception of cultural reality: age and gender’ (Polhemus, 1993: 10). What participants say about their poses also reminds us, that ‘women are not born but are taught to become feminine in ways that emphasize containment and control’ (Howson, 2004: 58).
<br>
    <br>
In 1979, Marianne Wex, a German feminist photographer, undertook the project “Let’s Take Back our Space”. She collected images, among which were sitting people and the gender contrast was sharply presented. Body Museum shows how little has changed for the last 40 years.
Let the photograph speak for themselves, proceed to our galleries or check out Instagram.
